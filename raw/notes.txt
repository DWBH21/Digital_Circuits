i will write program in java to generate karnaugh map. 
specifications: input: n - the number of variables, and an array of length 2^n whose elements are 0,1 or -1 corresponding to the output function
additional specification - the bit being taken into consideration -> 0 or 1 : this will help in generate the pos simplifications later:

okay, now algorithm (assumes additional specification is high):
i am going to use the quine mccluskey algorithm
1. for every 1, in the kmap, find the largest rectangle that encloses it. (find the prime implicants)
2. now create a ccounter for every one 

output: a set of rectangles: how can i uniquely specify a rectangle? 
	1. options : each rectangle is a list of indices( range 0 - 2*n-1)
	2. specified as a submatrix -> by the rows and columns they cover -> this feels good
	starting row of submatrix, starting col of submatrix , ending row of submatrix, ending col of submatrix

	
finally in js -> two options -> shade the respective rectangles or enclose a boundary around them
